   - Generates:
     - Required skills
     - Priority level
     - Helpful notes
     - Ticket type
  - Response generation is grounded locally through Ollama and Qdrant, with no external LLM API calls at runtime

   - Falls back to admin if no match found
   - Updates ticket with assignment

4. **Notification**
